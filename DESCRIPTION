Description: The `DPA` clustering is a fully unsupervised density-based 
    clustering that provides robust and visual information about the clusters, 
    their statistical reliability and their hierarchical organization. 
    It is a powerful alternative to the standard analysis frameworks with a 
    number of advantages: no need for dimensionality reduction techniques, 
    automatic detection of density peaks, identification of statistical 
    fluctuations for genuine clusters selection.
    The R package `DPAclustR` allows to exploit the Python library `DPA` by 
    means of the `reticulate` framework, and provides usefull visualization 
    methods with `networkD3` and `ggplot2`.
